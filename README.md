# UdeS Doctoral Research Code Repository

This repository contains code, experiments, and sandboxes developed during my doctoral studies at Université de Sherbrooke (UdeS).

## Overview

This repo is a personal workspace for exploring and developing ideas related to:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **Agentic and Generative AI (GenAI)**
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- Other topics as research evolves

## Purpose

- Serve as a sandbox for code experiments and prototypes
- Track progress and iterations throughout my doctoral journey
- Facilitate personal learning and exploration

## Technologies

- Python (primary language)
- Popular libraries and frameworks in AI, NLP, and GenAI (e.g., HuggingFace, LangChain, spaCy, etc.)

## Usage

This repository is intended for personal use and academic exploration. Feel free to explore, fork, or reference any code as you see fit.

## Structure

The repository structure may evolve, but typical folders may include:

- `experiments/` — Prototypes, trials, and proofs-of-concept
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for exploration and documentation
- `src/` — Source code for reusable components or modules
- `docs/` — Documentation, notes, and research logs

## Disclaimer

This codebase is primarily for educational and research purposes. It may contain incomplete, experimental, or unpolished code.
